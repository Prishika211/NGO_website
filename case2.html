                                    According to the Act relating to children, 2075 (2018) clause 60- every ward and municipal should form the Child Rights Committee (CRC). This committee is legally authorised and one of the major core committees to work for the well-being of children at the rural municipality level and the community. If we see the data so far in Nepal 222 of the 753 local levels across Nepal have formed Child Rights Committees. Since Pratappur Rural Municipality was unaware of this Committee, there wasn’t any CRC at the ward and rural municipality level.

                                    In collaboration with the rural municipality level focal person, UMN and partner Indreni Social Development Forum (INDRENI) conducted a series of formal and informal meetings regarding CRC formation in Pratappur. Finally, the vice-chairperson of Pratappur initiated this, and UMN provided technical support in its formation. Now Wards- one to 9 and the rural municipality level has also formulated CRC. At the municipal level CRC – the vice chairperson herself is the president and coordinator of the committee. Each CRC has 13 members as guided by the Act relating to children 2075 (2018) clause 60. The major objective of this CRC formation is to make a responsible, active, and functional committee or group to work against child issues. Therefore, the project organised three days of capacity-building training for CRC members to make them clear on their roles.

                                    After forming this CRC committee, it has been easier to address child protection issues from each ward. They are collecting data on children's issues and raising awareness for child rights.

                                    “CRC has been formed in the rural municipality and each ward level with the support of UMN, INDRENI and Pratappur. I do believe that this committee will work very actively for children’s rights,” shared Vice president Man K. Chaudhary. He further added, “Being a coordinator of this Municipal level CRC, I will play a vital role and encourage all the team members to bring positive change by reducing children’s issues and finally make a child-friendly rural municipality. For this, we need UMN and INDRENI’s continuous support and we are thankful for their guidance.” The CRC formation in the rural municipality level is counted as 223 in Nepal.
