                                    One day during our program for disabled people on Rokapur, we got notified about him. And after the discussion with ward Chairperson and the all the staffs in our office, we decided him to support a tri cycle from our budget of disabled people. Today, with the support of tri cycle from Indreni Social Development Forum; Raj Kishor is free to move anywhere without relying on others. He wanders a lot and is very happy to meet all his friends with help of this cycle. He can now move from one place to another. He says, “I don’t have to rely on others for a bottle of water. I can now go and drink it myself”. His younger brother says, “In the earlier days, he was unable to do any of the basic tasks but now with the help of this tricycle he does his works himself and everyone is so relieved.”
