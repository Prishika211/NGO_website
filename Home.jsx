  This organization was established on the 22nd of Kartik 2043 B.S. by the efforts of the conscious 
  youths of Panchanagar Village Development Committee of Savik Nawalparasi district, but despite making 
  a by law and trying hard for registration at the district administration office, the organization 
  could not be registered for 5 years. After the restoration of democracy in the country, it was only 
  in 2048 B.S. that it was able to be legally registered and legally recognized after the establishment 
  and registration of the association became an easy environment.

    <p>Smile Foundation’s flagship programme Mission Education works with the objective of empowering 
      underprivileged children by providing education, nutrition, and wellness support. The programme
      is well aligned to the New Education Policy (2020), and the SDG Goal 4 (Ensure inclusive and 
      equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all). Mission Education 
      works with children (3-18 years) living in difficult circumstances, children from poor families, 
      differently abled children, disaster-struck children, abandoned and street children, and children 
      living in tribal belts, remote villages and hard to reach areas.</p>

  <div className="whyeducation-cont">
    <p>If we need to address healthcare, poverty, population control, unemployment and human rights, there's 
      no better way to start than providing education to children in need. Education not only empowers children
     to have a secure future but also helps them grow up as responsible national and global citizens. The Right
       to Education (RTE) Act which came into force in 2010 made education free and compulsory for all children
       in the age group of 6-14 years. But even a decade later, the learning curve has not been steady for many
      children in the country. The socio-economic conditions of parents and lack of proper learning in schools
      are hindrances which prevent many children from having education.</p>
