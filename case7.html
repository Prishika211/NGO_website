                                    Child marriage, child labour, dowry system, substance abuse, suicide, drug addiction and discrimination are the major child protection issues in Pratappur Rural Municipality in Nawalparasi. One of the working areas of UMN, this place is located near India’s border and one of the main occupations is agriculture. Since there are brick kilns, child labour persists here. With parents abroad to earn income, children drop out of school in the middle and are deprived of their parent’s protection.

                                    Pratappur was unaware of the child protection policies, laws, and acts. Children related Act 2075 (2018) -Clause 61 has mentioned keeping one child welfare officer at every rural municipality level. A child welfare officer is a professional who is selected from the local government authority. As a focal person, the officer is responsible for looking after the rights of the children under foster care as well as address different issues and other basic rights of the children living within the rural municipality.

                                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt">
                                    The officer’s role is also to help a child or a young person in their understanding of the local authority processes, and their rights and allows the child to ask for more information or advice. UMN and its local partner Indreni Social Development Forum (INDRENI) have been implementing Strengthening Child Rights Project in Pratappur (SCRIP) since July 2022. The project’s goal is to contribute to establishing the long-term well-being, development, and prosperity of children hence to achieve this goal we must support the rural municipality to organise relevant tasks in the field such as Child Rights Committee (CRC) formation at the ward and rural municipality level and capacitate them on their roles and responsibility including child rights which was done successfully.

                                    To frequently lobby and advocate this act and to keep child welfare officers, finally, Pratappur has selected Sanjita Rauniyar from the department of women and children development section of the rural municipality. “I got this opportunity to play the role of the child welfare officer which was very new for me too. Now I will take part in a vital role to fulfil the role and responsibility of this position for children’s wellbeing,” shared Sanjita.  After selecting the child welfare officer, it has been very easy to conduct events, especially focusing on children’s cases in the rural municipality under SCRIP Project.
