The project creates the group by focusing on landless, seasonal wage labor, marginal farmers, single women (having responsibility to take care of family), PWDs, unemployed/jobless youth through COVID pandemic, low income people having less than NPR 6000 per month. With the aim of awaring people on the concept of handling their money better, financial literacy training was conducted to their group. To encourage them to start saving, a khutruke was a distributed to all the participants. After that training she started saving the money by cutting off her unnecessary expenses. She then started small kirana shop from her savings however she could not afford to buy tanki for her shop.

Along with that she has also started to grow some vegetables and sell them. She has now enough money to send school to their children. According to her, “I got courage to have shop from the financial literacy training but was not able to extend it to the higher level due to the lack of space for the groceries. Indreni has appeared as a blessings to me. Now, I have the confidence to work as an independent lady”.
