                                    In Pratappur Rural Municipality ward number 7, Jagatpur and Parsa tole, there is a mixed settlement of Dalits, Madhesi and Tharu. In Jagatpur, the number of Mushars is more and the people here are working as laborers and wage earners in India. The same problem exists in Parsa tol. About 42 households are in Parsa tol, while 40 households are in Jagatpur tole. Due to the problem of drinking water and toilets in that tole, people go outside to defecate, road problems in Persa tole, lack of irrigation, agriculture and public awareness are some of the problems existing in that area.
