                                    A person with a disability must overcome more challenges in their lifetime than do persons without disabilities. It can be difficult to deal with people's statements and get rid of the label "they cannot achieve anything." One illustration of this is Damodar Koiri. He is 35 years old and resides with his wife, two kids, and a daughter in Pratappur-08, Piparpati. Because of polio, he has a problem with one of his legs.

                                    Damodar Koiri has been a tailor for a very long time. He sews the garments for his neighborhood despite having a bad leg. He runs a tailoring business out of his house, where he makes a living. However, he was unable to improve his family's standard of living through his profession because his income could only be used to cover expenses with no room for savings. "I was unable to perform a variety of tasks because of the leg. My interest in sewing led me to decide to make it my job. However, I was never able to make much money from it since I lacked the funds to grow my company”, said Damodar Koiri.

This group was created in 2022 by the project named ReLive which was implemented by INDRENI in partnership of UMNMDT. He is one of the active member in his group and has participated in many trainings organized by the project. He was selected as the entreprenurs for the need based vocational training(tailoring). However, he noted that he already had the ability to sew clothing and that what he really wanted was the sewing tool support package so that he could broaden his line of work. The project supported him with materials required for sewing of the clothes of worth equal to Nrs. 30,000. He was very happy to receive the support. Now, for his convenience, he has installed a motor in the machine. Currently he has kept one of the staff for sewing and also have started selling the cloths . He added” "I am currently earning a really nice income for my family," he continued. Even the extra money from my income has begun to go into savings. With addition of the new sewing machine income has increased by Nrs. 10, 000. I now have renewed hope about expanding my company and giving my family and a comfortable and happy life. ReLive has done excellent work for communities like ours that are marginalized. I'm grateful for it a lot."
