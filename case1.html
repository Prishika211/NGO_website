                                    Jagarnathpur Health Post is providing health services with 19 employees currently which includes a physician and an ayurvedic physician. This health post was shifted from Suryapura VDC of Jagarnathpur to Semari of Jamuniya VDC in 2039 BS (1982). Now 40 to 50 patients receive services every day from this primary health centre. Patients from all the wards of Pratappur Rural Municipality including Bardaghat, Susta, Sarawal, Binayi Tribeni and even from Maharajganj of India UP to Balmikinagar of Bihar have been coming for treatment at Jagarnathpur Health Post. Pregnant women and patients from other municipalities of Nawalparasi also visit here.

                                    Outpatient (EMT), laboratory facilities, pregnancy and maternity services, leprosy, and tuberculosis (TB) screening and treatment, vaccination and family planning services, Video X-ray (GCN), echinacea and cataract services are in operation. Also, free medicine and other services are being provided with 5% discount on other prescription drugs. During the identification of the needs of the health institution, few labs and USG machines were identified to be facing a problem. Due to the breakdown of the USG machine, the medical officer was providing services by bringing his machine, but even then, the patients were deprived of the service due to the breakdown.

                                    During the meeting with the health team in the municipality, a USG machine was identified as needed at Jagarnathpur because the patients were returning without this service. A meeting was held with the health coordinator, and it was discussed that there was a project named Improving Health System Response to COVID-19 being regulated by UMNâ€™s partner Indreni Social Development Forum (INDRENI) with the financial support from Australian Aid.

                                    INDRENI also provided health equipment, safety materials such as USG machine and lab materials. After the support, 415 patients and pregnant women have received the services till now. USG service is provided free of cost for poor patients and for a low fee of NPR 500 (approx. AUD 5) for others of which 50% is spent on office management and 50% is for doctors. The difficulty of providing services due to lack of required staffing, staff management has now become easier and poor patients and pregnant women have been able to get services with ease. They have been relieved from the hassle of having to pay extra fees and get services even in difficult situations. Till now, USG service has been provided to 30 very underprivileged people.
